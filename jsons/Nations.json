		"startIntroPart1": "Salutations, Mr. Robert Edwin House, stalwart leader of New Vegas! With unparalleled intellect and ingenuity, you rose to power as a technological magnate in the years before the Great War - a conflict which you foresaw and extensively prepared for. Your calculations proved almost perfect, and it was thanks to your efforts that Las Vegas was spared from nuclear destruction. The chips were almost all in place to establish your beloved city and lead humanity into the future, save one very important chip – the Platinum Chip. And though you did not realize it, your centuries of planning and humanity's fate hinged entirely on one external factor you could not predict nor control – a Courier.",
		"startIntroPart2": "Mr. House, Vegas calls for your leadership. Will you restore her glory and influence as an economic powerhouse, hosting visitors from the world over?

		"tradeRequest": "I like to think that you have enough sense to make the right decision. The rewards for doing so are immense... as are the punishments for not doing so.",
